Acts 4:16-21 MKJV
(16) Saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all those dwelling in Jerusalem. And we cannot deny it.
(17) But, so that it spread no further among the people, let us strictly threaten them, that they speak to no man in this name
(18) And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all, nor to teach in the name of Jesus.
(19) But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right before God to listen to you more than to God, you judge.
(20) For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
(21) So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way as to how they might punish them, because of the people. For all glorified God for that which was done.

Acts 5:16-42 WNT
(16) The inhabitants, too, of the towns in the neighborhood of Jerusalem came in crowds, bringing sick persons [to the apostles of Christ] and some who were harassed by foul spirits, and they were cured, one and all.
(17) This roused the High Priest. He and all his party–the sect of the Sadducees–were filled with angry jealousy
(18) and laid hands upon the Apostles, and put them into the public jail.
(19) But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,
(20) “Go and stand in the Temple, and go on proclaiming to the people all this Message of Life.”
(21) Having received that command they went into the Temple, just before daybreak, and began to teach: So when the High Priest and his party came, and had called together the Sanhedrin as well as all the Elders of the descendants of Israel, they sent to the jail to fetch the Apostles.
(22) But the officers went and could not find them in the prison. So they came back and brought word,
(23) saying, “The jail we found quite safely locked, and the warders were on guard at the doors, but upon going in we found no one there.”
(24) When the Commander of the Temple Guards and the High Priests heard this statement, they were utterly at a loss with regard to it, wondering what would happen next.
(25) And some one came and brought them word, saying, “The men you put in prison are actually in the Temple, standing there, teaching the people.”
(26) Upon this the Commander went with the officers, and brought the Apostles; but without using violence; for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.
(27) So they brought them and made them stand in front of the Sanhedrin. And then the High Priest questioned them.
(28) “We strictly forbad you to teach in that Name–did we not?” he said. “And see, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and are trying to make us responsible for that man’s death!”
(29) Peter and the other Apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than man.
(30) The God of our forefathers has raised Jesus to life, Whom you crucified and put to death.
(31) God has exalted Him to His right hand as Chief Leader and as Savior, to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.
(32) And we–and the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him–are witnesses as to these things.”
(33) Infuriated at getting this answer, they were disposed to kill the Apostles.
(34) But a Pharisee of the name of Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, held in honor by all the people, rose from his seat and requested that they should be sent outside the court for a few minutes.
(35) “Israelites,” he said, “be careful what you are about to do in dealing with these men.
(36) Years ago Theudas appeared, professing to be a person of importance, and a body of men, some four hundred in number, joined him. He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and annihilated.
(37) After him, at the time of the Census, came Judas, the Galilaean, and was the leader in a revolt. He too perished, and all his followers were scattered.
(38) And now I tell you to hold aloof from these men and leave them alone–for if this scheme or work is of human origin, it will come to nothing.
(39) But if it is really from God, you will be powerless to put them down–lest perhaps you find yourselves to be actually fighting against God.”
(40) His advice carried conviction. So they called the Apostles in, and–after flogging them–ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and then let them go.
(41) They, therefore, left the Sanhedrin and went their way, rejoicing that they had been deemed worthy to suffer disgrace on behalf of the NAME.
(42) But they did not desist from teaching every day, in the Temple or in private houses, and telling the good news about Jesus, the Christ.

Acts 6:8-15 MKJV
(8) And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
(9) Then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and from Asia, disputing with Stephen.
(10) And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
(11) And they induced men to be saying, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.
(12) And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes. And coming on, they seized him and brought him to the Sanhedrin.
(13) And they set up false witnesses, who said, This man does not cease speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the Law.
(14) For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
(15) And looking intently at him. All those sitting in the Sanhedrin saw his face as if it were the face of an angel.

Acts 7:51-60 MKJV
(51) O stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so you do.
(52) Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One, of Whom you have now been the betrayers and murderers;
(53) Who received the Law through disposition of angels, and did not keep it.
(54) And hearing these things, they were cut to their hearts. And they gnashed on him with their teeth.
(55) But being full of the Holy Spirit, looking up intently into Heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
(56) And he said, Behold, I see Heaven opened and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God.
(57) And crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their ears and ran on him with one accord.
(58) And throwing him outside the city, they stoned him. And the witnesses laid their clothes down at the feet of a young man named Saul.
(59) And they stoned Stephen, who was calling on God and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
(60) And kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not lay this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

Acts 8:1-3 MKJV
(1) And Saul was consenting to his death. And in that day there was a great persecution on the church at Jerusalem, and all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
(2) And devout men buried Stephen and made a great mourning over him.
(3) But Saul ravaged the church, entering into every house. And dragging men and women, he delivered them up to prison.

Acts 9:1-6 MKJV
(1) And Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
(2) and asked letters from him to Damascus to the synagogues; so that if he found any of the Way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
(3) But in going, it happened as he drew near to Damascus, even suddenly a light from the heaven shone around him.
(4) And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?
(5) And he said, Who are you, lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus Whom you persecute. It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
(6) And trembling and astonished, he said, Lord, what will You have me to do? And the Lord said to him, Arise and go into the city, and you shall be told what you must do.

Acts 22:17-21 GNB
(17) “I [Saul] went back to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the Temple, I had a vision,
(18) in which I saw the Lord, as He said to me, ‘Hurry and leave Jerusalem quickly, because the people here will not accept your witness about Me.’
(19) ‘Lord,’ I answered, ‘they know very well that I went to the synagogues and arrested and beat those who believe in you.
(20) And when your witness Stephen was put to death, I myself was there, approving of his murder and taking care of the cloaks of his murderers.’
(21) ‘Go,’ the Lord said to me, ‘for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’ ”

Leviticus 26:40-45 HNV
(40) “‘If they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against Me, and also that, because they walked contrary to Me,
(41) I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity;
(42) then I will remember My covenant with Ya`akov; and also My covenant with Yitzchak, and also My covenant with Avraham; and I will remember the land.
(43) The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them: and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected My ordinances, and their soul abhorred My statutes.
(44) Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God;
(45) but I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the LORD.'”

Isaiah 11:1-10 KJV
(1) And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:
(2) And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;
(3) And shall make Him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and He shall not judge after the sight of His eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:
(4) But with righteousness shall He judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall He slay the wicked.
(5) And righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and faithfulness the girdle of His reins.
(6) The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
(7) And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
(8) And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice’ den.
(9) They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
(10) And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and His rest shall be glorious.
